	///     Class <c>QuadraticSpline1D</c> describes a one-dimensional quadratic spline, which is a piecewise function.
	///		Each piece is defined by a quadratic function, \f$q(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2\f$, for which the parameters
	///		are defined such that the piecewise function is continuous. A spline is defined by a series of points that
	///		the function must intersect, and the program will automatically generate a curve that passes through these
	///		points. As opposed to a cubic spline, a quadratic spline is not continuous in its second derivative. It is
	///		therefore 'less smooth', but as a result it is possible to raytrace a quadratic spline analytically.

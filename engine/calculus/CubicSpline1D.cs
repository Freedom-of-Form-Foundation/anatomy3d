	///     Class <c>CubicSpline1D</c> describes a one-dimensional cubic spline, which is a piecewise function.
	///		Each piece is defined by a cubic function, \f$q(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3\f$, for which the
	///		parameters are defined such that the piecewise function is continuous. A spline is defined by a series of
	///		points that the function must intersect, and the program will automatically generate a curve that passes
	///		through these points. A cubic spline is continuous in its derivative and its second derivative. It is
	/// 	therefore 'smoother' than a quadratic spline, but as a result it is not analytically raytracable when used
	/// 	as a heightmap.
